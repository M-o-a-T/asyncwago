Description: Access I/O on Wago controllers
 This library controls access to I/O on Wago controllers.
 These are industrial devices with various analog and digital extension modules.
 They run a basic embedded Linux. Older models don't even have a MMU.
 .
 A small control program needs to run on the controller.
 You can get its source from the `Wago Firmware <http://github.com/M-o-a-T/wago-firmware>`__ archive.
